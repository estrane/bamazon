# bamazon

Mock up of Amazon using Node, Inquirer and MySQL.

To start, make sure to npm install when loaded in all the files.

Open MySQL Workbench or something similar and copy-paste over the bamazonSeed.sql data.

Create the table, make sure everything is there.

Use the terminal and type in 'node bamazonCustomer.js' to run the application.

Use inquirer to help fill in blanks and run the simple app of potentially purchasing items.

Drop and re-create the database to test further or add more items later on.
